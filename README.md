# Welcome to Thjalfi!

Thjalfi is/will be a C++ chess engine using bitboards. I decided to create this project because I have been wanting to create a chess engine for a long time, and I think making a whole project will improve my programming skills better than any studying can.

- [x]  Make a board representation
- [x] Add ability to parse FEN
- [x] Add ability to print board to console
- [ ] Implement rules/search legal moves
- [ ] Implement evaluation
- [ ] Implement UCI
